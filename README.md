# ZX Spectrum Assembly Labs

**Nanoprojects laboratory in Z80 Assembly for the ZX Spectrum 48k.**
Every .asm file on this project is an experiment focused on learning, testing or mastering a specific concept - from register manipulation to creating full games using assembly.

--

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To document my journey of learning Z80 assembly in the context of ZX Spectrum.
This repo focuses on **modular nanoprojects**, each one teaching something useful and reusable for future projects.

--

## ðŸ§  My Personal Philosophy

- Learning by doing - not just following tutorials
- Writing everything manually, trying to understand every instruction
- Being prolific: producing nanoprojects everyday, if possible
- Sharing knowledge to inspire others to learn assembly and how de ZX Spectrum works
- There are no mistakes, only learning
- Never give up! ðŸ¦¾

## ðŸ’¾ Requirements

- [sjasmplus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus) (the assembler I'm using in these labs)
- ZX Spectrum emulator (Ex.: SpecEmu, Fuse, ZXSpin, Spectaculator, EmuZWin)

## ðŸŽ® How to Run the NanoProjects Without Assembling Them

The **snapshots** folder contains pre-assembled `.sna` files.
You can load any nanoproject directly in your prefered ZX Spectrum emulator without having to build it first.
